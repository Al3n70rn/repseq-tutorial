Datasets
--------

The tutorial contains the following datasets:

-  Raw sequencing reads (paired-end FASTQ) coming from 
   two samples taken from the same individual, 
   1000 T-cells each. Together with them comes
   ``barcodes.txt`` storing information for de-multiplexing. 
   To be used in Task 1.
-  Diversity estimates generated by VDJtools for data from
   79 donors of various age (umbilical cord blood to
   103 y/o individual), down-sampled to ~300,000 T-cells each.
   To be used in Task 2
-  Table with pairwise similarities computed for the 
   repertoires of those 79 donors. To be used in Task 3
   
The latter two are pre-computed for several reasons: 
original clonotype tables are ~2GB in total so it would take long 
to download them, it requires substantial amount of time to analyze the data 
(~20 min on 8-core machine), it requires ~30GB RAM to 
load samples into memory in order to speed-up pairwise 
similarity computation. Still, similar tables can be obtained 
by running ``Downsample`` followed by ``CalcDiversityStats`` 
and ``CalcPairwiseDistances`` VDJtools routines using the 
examples provided in https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools-examples 
(``aging/`` folder).
   
The dataset are stored in the tutorial repository, to clone
them run:

git clone https://github.com/mikessh/embo-diversity-course

The datasets will be stored in ``part1/``, ``part2/`` and 
``part3/`` folders respectively.
