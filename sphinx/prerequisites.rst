Prerequisites
-------------

Datasets
^^^^^^^^

The tutorial contains the following datasets:

-  Raw sequencing reads (paired-end FASTQ) coming from 
   two samples taken from the same individual, 
   1000 T-cells each. Together with them comes
   ``barcodes.txt`` storing information for de-multiplexing. 
   To be used in Part 1.
-  Diversity estimates generated by VDJtools for data from
   39 donors of various age. To be used in Part 2 and 3
   
Datasets are stored in the tutorial repository, to download
them run:

.. code:: bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/mikessh/repseq-tutorial

they can be found in ``part1/`` and ``part2/`` folders respectively.

Software
^^^^^^^^

All software tools necessary for this tutorial are stored in the 
``repseq-tutorial`` repository as well.

.. warning::

    Java v1.8+ is required to run these tools.

MIGEC
~~~~~

A pipeline for processing of RepSeq data, focused on UMI-tagged 
reads. There are 5 steps of MIGEC pipeline:

-  **Checkout** De-multiplexing, UMI sequence extraction, 
   read re-orientation, adapter trimming
-  **Histogram** UMI coverage statistics
-  **Assemble** Assemble consensus sequences from reads
   tagged with the same UMI. Filters out low-coverage and
   erroneous UMIs.
-  **CdrBlast** V-(D)-J mapping and clonotype assembly
-  **FilterCdrBlastResults** Additional correction of 
   hot-spot errors.
   
**Latest binaries**: https://github.com/mikessh/migec/releases/latest

MITCR
~~~~~

A software for fast and robust processing of TCR sequencing 
data. The software performs V-(D)-J mapping, clonotype assembly 
with frequency-based error correction and low-quality read 
rescue via re-mapping to assembled clonotypes.

**Latest binaries**: http://mitcr.milaboratory.com/downloads/

**Docs**: http://mitcr.milaboratory.com/documentation/

VDJtools
~~~~~~~~

A framework for post-analysis of immune repertoire sequencing 
data. Includes 20+ analysis modules: from simple routines such 
as spectratyping to diversity estimation and repertoire clustering
modules.

**Latest binaries**: https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools/releases/latest

**Docs**: http://vdjtools-doc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules.html

.. important:: 

    As VDJtools performs some plotting via R, so it can throw an 
    error that a specific R package is lacking. Those packages 
    should be installed with ``install.packages`` command 
    in R shell.
    
    Alternatively, one can run ``java -jar vdjtools-1.0.2.jar RInstall`` 
    to allow VDJtools intall all R packages it uses (will take a substantial amount of time).
    
    The list of required packages:
    
    :: 
    
       reshape, ggplot2, gridExtra, FField,
       ape, reshape2, MASS, plotrix, RColorBrewer,
       scales
